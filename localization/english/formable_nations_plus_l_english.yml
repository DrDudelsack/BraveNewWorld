However, the land of Dacia is close to the rich and decadent Hellenic civilizations of the south and is protected from the horse-lords via the Carpathian mountains to the north; by establishing Dacia as our new homeland, we will be in the perfect position to set up a kingdom made prosperous from raiding the great cities of the Aegean with impunity."

While there is little of value worth looting in this desolate backwater, merely surviving here presents a challenge in of itself found nowhere else, much less thriving; by taking it head-on and overcoming the odds to conquer Scandia, we will prove to the world that our warriors are the greatest of all time."

However, should either the Danube freeze or the Alps be crossed, the divided Vindelicians would be unable to defend themselves from their neighbors; if we were to confederate the other Vindelician tribes under a single leader, we could coordinate our forces and ward off those who would dare subjugate us."

The territory, however, like so many others which followed, was lost to us when the barbarous Macedons invaded and destroyed our empire; now that we have at last reclaimed the region, we can officially re-establish the satrapy and proclaim ourselves its Pharaoh-governors."
